## Project Description
This project is a Contact-Manager Web API that allows users to register and login in order to create, update, and delete their phone contacts. It is built using MongoDB as the database.

## Purpose
- To solidify my understanding of CRUD functionality 

- To become more acquainted with User Authentication

## What I learned from this project:
- The proper approach to structure my project, which is the MVC structure for most backend projects

- Novel methods or approaches to querying the database when performing CRUD operations.

- I learned about the bcrypt package and some fundamental password hashing algorithms.

- The significance of the jsonwebtoken in communicating information to the client.

## How to Install & Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   - run in your terminal
   ```
     git clone https://github.com/RICHYDOS/Contact-Manager
   ```
3. Change into the repository root directory
   ```
     cd Contact-Manager
   ```
5. Install Dependencies
   ```
      npm install
   ```
7. Set up MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas:
  - This project is geared toward connecting to MongoDB Atlas
  - Set up the `.env` file in the root directory as seen in the `.env.example` file
  - Adjust the MongoDB connection URI in the project's `.env` file if necessary.
  - You can install MongoDB and run it on your local machine although you will have to make the necessary changes in the           `index.js` file
5. Start the server:
  ```
      npm run start
  ```
  - You should see in the terminal:
    ```
      > contact-manager@1.0.0 start
      > node index.js
      Server running on Port < PortNumber >
      Connected to < DatabaseName >
    ```
