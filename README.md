# Contact-Manager

"This is a basic Contact Management backend API. Why am I constructing this?
- To solidify my understanding of CRUD functionality 

- To become more acquainted with User Authentication


What I learned from this project:
- The proper approach to structure my project, which is the MVC structure for most backend projects

- Novel methods or approaches to querying the database when performing CRUD operations

- I learned about the bcrypt package and some fundamental password hashing algorithms.

- The significance of the jsonwebtoken in communicating information to the client"
